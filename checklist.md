Use this checklist to track your progress and ensure your Weather Advisor project meets all requirements before submission.

## Repository Setup

* [x] Repository created from template
* [x] README.md updated with your project information
* [x] Instructor (michael-borck) invited to your repository

## Notebook Organisation

* [x] Notebook has clear section headers using markdown cells
* [x] Sections are logically organised and follow the required structure
* [x] Code includes appropriate comments and docstrings
* [x] No unused code or unnecessary cells
* [x] All imports are at the top of the notebook or in the appropriate section

## Weather Data Component

* [x] Successfully retrieves weather data from chosen source
* [x] Handles connection errors and timeouts gracefully
* [x] Validates user input (e.g., city names, parameters)
* [x] Processes and structures the data for use in the application
* [x] Provides meaningful error messages for users

## Visualisation Component

* [x] Implements at least 2 different visualisation types
* [x] All visualisations have proper titles, labels, and legends
* [x] Visualisations are readable and use appropriate colors
* [x] Handles edge cases (e.g., missing data, extreme values)
* [x] Visualisations are relevant to the data being displayed

## Natural Language Interface

* [x] Successfully parses user questions to extract key information
* [x] Identifies locations in user queries
* [x] Identifies time periods in user queries (today, tomorrow, etc.)
* [x] Identifies weather attributes (temperature, rain, etc.)
* [x] Generates natural-sounding responses to user questions

## User Interface

* [x] Implements a clear menu system using pyinputplus
* [x] Provides appropriate feedback to users
* [x] Has a logical flow between different options
