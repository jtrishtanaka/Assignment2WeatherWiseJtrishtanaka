Me: How do I parse temperature from this weather JSON?  
AI: You can use `weather["current_condition"][0]["temp_C"]` to access the temperature in Celsius. It’s nested within a list under the key `"current_condition"`.

Me: What if it’s missing or causes an error?  
AI: Add a try/except block to handle missing data gracefully. For example:  
    try:  
        temp = data['current_condition'][0]['temp_C']  
    except (KeyError, IndexError):  
        temp = "Unavailable"

Me: How are forecast dates extracted from the JSON?  
AI: The forecast is stored in `data['weather']`, a list of daily entries. Each contains a `"date"` string:  
    for day in data['weather']:  
        print(day['date'])

Me: Why is `hourly[4]` used when accessing forecast data?  
AI: It represents the 12:00 PM slot — midday. Using a consistent time makes comparisons reliable:  
    midday_temp = day['hourly'][4]['tempC']

Me: What’s the purpose of the `visualise_forecast` function?  
AI: It generates visual graphs using matplotlib. The user selects Rainfall, Temperature, or Both from a menu.

Me: Can you give an example of how it builds the rainfall graph?  
AI: Certainly:  
    rainfall = [float(day['hourly'][4]['precipMM']) for day in forecast]  
    plt.plot(dates, rainfall, marker='o')

Me: How does the app decide which graph to show?  
AI: It uses `pyip.inputMenu()` to collect the user’s choice and then branches with `if` statements accordingly.

Me: How are city names extracted from a question?  
AI: Through regex in `parse_question()`:  
    location_match = re.search(r"in ([a-zA-Z\s]+)", question)

Me: What happens if no location is found?  
AI: The code defaults to `"London"` so that the function remains robust and always returns something useful.

Me: How is future weather retrieved?  
AI: By using `day_offset` from the parsed question:  
    future_weather = data['weather'][day_offset]

Me: How is the main menu logic structured?  
AI: With a `while True` loop and input validation:  
    while True:  
        choice = pyip.inputMenu([...])  
        if choice == "Exit":  
            break

Me: Can I fetch both current and future weather in one question?  
AI: Not yet. But by expanding `parse_question()` to detect multiple date indicators, you could support that.

Me: How does the quote system work?  
AI: It personalizes the experience with a randomly chosen motivational quote:  
    quote = random.choice(quotes).replace("{name}", name)

Me: Is there a fallback if the API fails?  
AI: Yes, wrapped in a try/except block:  
    try:  
        response = requests.get(...)  
    except requests.RequestException:  
        print("Unable to fetch data")

Me: Why use `inputMenu()` instead of regular input?  
AI: It prevents invalid input. The user can only choose from predefined, controlled options.

Me: Can I save the generated plots?  
AI: Absolutely. Just add:  
    plt.savefig("forecast_graph.png")  
Before calling `plt.show()`.

Me: What does `display_current_weather()` print exactly?  
AI: It summarizes the location, temperature, humidity, and description:  
    print(f"{location}: {temp}°C, {desc}, Humidity: {humidity}%")

Me: Could I add unit conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit?  
AI: Yes. Convert using:  
    temp_f = round((int(temp_c) * 9/5) + 32)

Me: How does it handle different types of questions?  
AI: It matches simple keywords like “today”, “tomorrow”, “in” using conditional checks and regex.

Me: Could this evolve into a chatbot?  
AI: Definitely. Add a message loop and hook into the Telegram or Discord API for real-time interaction.

Me: How would I test this code?  
AI: Use `unittest` and mock the API response:  
    with patch("requests.get") as mock_get:  
        mock_get.return_value.json.return_value = mock_data

Me: Final advice?  
AI: Keep functions modular, expect bad input, and aim for a great UX. Make the code bulletproof and clear.
