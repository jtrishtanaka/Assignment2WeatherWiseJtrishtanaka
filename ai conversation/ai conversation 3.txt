Me: What’s the purpose of the `get_weather()` function?  
AI: It handles API requests to WeatherAPI, sending a query and returning parsed JSON weather data for a given location.

Me: Where does the API URL come from?  
AI: It's built dynamically using string formatting:  
    url = f"http://api.weatherapi.com/v1/forecast.json?...&q={location}&days=3"

Me: Why does it use `requests.get()`?  
AI: This function sends an HTTP GET request to the URL and waits for the weather data to be returned.

Me: What happens if the API call fails?  
AI: The function is wrapped in a `try/except` block. If there's a `requests.RequestException`, it prints an error and returns `None`.

Me: What are the parameters of `get_weather()`?  
AI: It takes one argument — `location`, a string (like "Harare" or "Bulawayo").

Me: Why `days=3` in the URL?  
AI: That ensures the API returns weather data for the current day and the next two — essential for forecasts.

Me: What headers or auth does it use?  
AI: The API key is passed as part of the URL using `key={api_key}` — no separate headers needed.

Me: Where is the API key stored?  
AI: It’s pulled from a separate file:  
    from config import API_KEY

Me: How is the response parsed?  
AI: The response from `requests.get()` is converted to JSON using `.json()`:  
    return response.json()

Me: Does it check for HTTP errors?  
AI: Not directly. Adding `response.raise_for_status()` before parsing would help catch HTTP errors more explicitly.

Me: Can it return partial data if something’s missing?  
AI: Not in its current state. If parsing fails, the whole call fails and `None` is returned.

Me: Is the function reusable?  
AI: Very much so — it’s modular. You can call `get_weather("Gweru")` or any city and get full structured data back.

Me: What kind of object does it return?  
AI: A dictionary parsed from the JSON response — typically containing `location`, `current`, and `forecast` keys.

Me: Can I print the whole forecast from it?  
AI: Yes. After calling `data = get_weather("Harare")`, just access `data['forecast']['forecastday']`.

Me: What if I pass in a misspelled city?  
AI: The API will return a 400 error or empty results. You could add validation before sending the request.

Me: Could I change the function to also accept coordinates?  
AI: Yes. The API accepts both city names and coordinates. Modify the function to detect and use either.

Me: Why not use POST instead of GET?  
AI: GET is standard for data retrieval. POST is used when sending or updating data — not applicable here.

Me: What’s the returned structure like?  
AI: A typical response has:  
    { "location": {...}, "current": {...}, "forecast": { "forecastday": [...] } }

Me: Is caching used in the function?  
AI: Not currently. Adding a local cache or using `functools.lru_cache` could reduce API calls.

Me: Could I add retry logic in case of a timeout?  
AI: Definitely. Use `requests.adapters` or wrap the request in a retry loop with `time.sleep()`.

Me: Is it safe to expose the API key in code?  
AI: No. Always keep it in a `.env` file or config module that's not pushed to version control.

Me: Can I unit test this function?  
AI: Yes. Mock the `requests.get()` call with `unittest.mock` to simulate API responses.

Me: What’s the best way to improve it?  
AI: Add response validation, better error messages, retry logic, and possibly logging.
