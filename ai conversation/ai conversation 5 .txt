Me: What’s the very first thing this program does?  
AI: It starts by importing necessary modules — `requests` for API calls, `json` for parsing, `matplotlib.pyplot` for plotting, and optionally `os` for environment variables.

Me: Why use a separate function for `get_weather()`?  
AI: Modularity. It keeps your code readable, testable, and reusable — a core principle in clean architecture.

Me: What exactly does `get_weather(city)` do?  
AI: It builds a request URL using the base endpoint and city, sends a GET request, and returns JSON if successful.

Me: How is the API key managed?  
AI: Ideally through an environment variable using `os.getenv("API_KEY")` — this keeps it secure and off GitHub.

Me: What if the API request fails?  
AI: The function uses `try/except` to catch `requests.exceptions.RequestException`, and returns `None` if something goes wrong.

Me: What does the main driver of the script look like?  
AI: It checks if `__name__ == "__main__"` and then prompts the user for a city, calling `get_weather()` and proceeding only if valid data is returned.

Me: Where does temperature parsing happen?  
AI: In a function like `parse_current_temp(data)` that safely accesses `data["current_condition"][0]["temp_C"]` using a try/except block.

Me: Why not access JSON values directly in the main code?  
AI: Separation of concerns. Parsing functions can be tested in isolation, and it protects against malformed responses.

Me: What happens if the temperature field is missing?  
AI: You’ll get a fallback message or a default value, thanks to the error-handling inside the parsing function.

Me: How is the forecast data handled?  
AI: Another function like `parse_forecast(data)` loops through `data["forecast"]["forecastday"]` and extracts `date`, `avgtemp_c`, and `humidity`.

Me: How is this forecast data stored?  
AI: Usually in three lists — `dates`, `temps`, and `humidities` — to be passed into visualization functions.

Me: Where do the visualizations come in?  
AI: After parsing, you pass those lists to functions like `plot_temperature(dates, temps)` and `plot_humidity(dates, humidities)`.

Me: What do those plotting functions look like?  
AI: They call `plt.plot()` or `plt.bar()`, set titles and labels, call `plt.tight_layout()`, and finish with `plt.show()`.

Me: How is user feedback handled if something goes wrong?  
AI: The program prints error messages like “Could not retrieve weather data. Please check the city name.”

Me: Can you show me a sample of the temperature plotting code?  
AI: Sure:  
    def plot_temperature(dates, temps):  
        plt.plot(dates, temps, marker='o', color='orange')  
        plt.title("3-Day Temp Forecast")  
        plt.xlabel("Date")  
        plt.ylabel("Temp (°C)")  
        plt.tight_layout()  
        plt.show()

Me: How do you know what structure the JSON has?  
AI: From the WeatherAPI documentation or printing `json.dumps(data, indent=4)` during testing.

Me: Can I extend this to show more weather details?  
AI: Absolutely — just find the fields in the JSON and follow the same structure: parse ➝ store ➝ display.

Me: What are some good practices shown here?  
AI: Separation of logic, use of functions, error handling, and making the code readable and modular.

Me: What could I add to make this production-ready?  
AI: Logging, better input validation, config file support, unit tests, and maybe a GUI or web frontend.

Me: Why is `__name__ == "__main__"` important?  
AI: It ensures your script doesn’t auto-run when imported into another module or test file.

Me: What if I want this to run in a loop?  
AI: You can wrap the main interaction in a `while True:` loop and let users type “exit” to quit.

Me: Can I store previous results in a file?  
AI: Yes — append parsed results to a `.txt` or `.csv` file using Python’s `open()` function in append mode.

Me: What’s one thing that could trip people up in this code?  
AI: Assuming the API always returns data. It can fail silently if the city is invalid or the quota’s used up — hence the need for checks.
